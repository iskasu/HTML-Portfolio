<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Suki!</h1>
<p>
    I'm excited to start my coding journey with Angela Yu's Web Development Course. It's a big step toward a new chapter in my career!
</p>

<p>
    I graduated in 2023 from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) with a degree in <strong>Business Analytics</strong>. While I currently work in finance, Iâ€™ve realized that tech is where my true passion lies. 
    I found myself more fascinated by technology than business, which is why Iâ€™m here, learning to code and eager to embrace a new career direction.
